# InWork


# This is a modified version of the original Poiyomi Shader
The main goal is to bring support for the reactive Luma/Audio structure pixels that are used to make the avatars react in the [Furality](https://furality.org/) convention's worlds.

The structure was made to work with the Furality's own shader and be controlled in real time by VJs during Furality's events, but the shader has to support it to react to the world.
Furality's shader is nice and is the best to use for the event if you don't already have audiolink materials on your avatars or have time to port them.
I'll use both myself as the Furality shader has nice themed effects too.

But if you're like me, you might already have a bunch of Avatars using poiyomi with audiolink reactive materials and a bunch of audiolink tweaked effects, migrating all avatars and materials to Furality's shader would be a lot of work and to do in a short time.

This shader will be a drop in replacement for the original poiyomi that will allow you to reuse these audiolink materials as-is and make them react inside of Furality's worlds without further modifications.
They will however react "poiyomi style" and depend on your poiyomi's audiolink configuration.

This version of the shader will allow you to inject and remap into audiolink's 4 audio channels:
- The 2 Furality audio channels (LOW and HIGH)
- The 4 Luma "Heroes and Vilains" Zones (they will most likely be called differently for furality Aqua but the data structure is the same, so they should work the same)
